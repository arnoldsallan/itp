Javascript Reading Ch 1 
1 thing I knew: I knew that bits were described as zeros and ones.  
1 thing I did not know: Honestly, I did not know alot of what they were talking about in this chapter.  I was surprised to see how much math is involved, re arithmatic and multiple other types of formulas.  There seems to be alot for me to learn when it comes to this, especially with all the different operators for the math, the strings, logic, and unary operators.  Looking forward to learning more about this 

Ch 2 
1 thing I knew: I knew that basics of a fragment of code being called an "expression"
1 thing I didn't know:  Once again, alot of this chapter was "gibberish" to me.  Bindings, Functions, Return values, Control flow, conditional execution, loops, fizzbuzz, and the other topics are all new and don't make much sense to me as of right now. 

Ch3
1 thing I knew: I have a very basic understanding of "functions".  How i interpret that is that it's a command or program that can make a program do what it's supposed to do? 
1 thing I did not know: This is almost embarassing at this point, but once again this has been very confusing text for me.  It seems that most of this lingo is completely new to me.  Regarding functions, I didn't realize how in depth and algorithimic this is.
