For this process, we utilized HTML and a .css file.  We started with discussing the visual aspect of the site.  We decided on colors, fonts, etc.  From there we each individually wrote our bios.  Then we decided on a name.  

We also decided to include photographs of each one of us, and we also decided to include a hyperlink that leads to our debut album.  

To get to the photographs, we had to upload them to the repository, and make sure the code fetched those resources.  We also added accesibility features, for visually impaired.  

To assist with this, we used the website provided with .css templates, as well as utizling professor romes sample website , and referencing that code to ours.  

We ran into an issue where the website was giving us a 404 error.  I did ask Chat GPT to let us know potential issues that could have caused this, but the suggestions given were irrelevant to what was happening. We asked our teacher for help and It was pointed out to us by Prof that it was a repesitory name issue that could have been causing this.  We changed the repository name back and it worked!  

Last part was adding the link to our "debut performance", and we did that to make a hyperlink that led to a Youtube video of that epic performance. 

We tested our website on our individual computers and it worked!  WOOOOOOOOOO!!!
