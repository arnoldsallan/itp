I began this project by compiling data for five major Marvel characters: Spider-Man, X-Men, Daredevil, Wolverine, and The Punisher. Using multiple online resources, my personal Marvel Unlimited subscription, and my own background knowledge, I slowly built a chronological reading order for each character. This process took a few weeks, as it required researching issue numbers, story arcs, major crossover events, and adaptations. Organizing all this information into a usable format was a major challenge in itself, but once that foundation was set, I was ready to move forward.

Since the assignment required using LaTeX — a platform I had never used before — I turned to ChatGPT for guidance. The AI recommended Overleaf as the best online LaTeX editor, and from that point on, I built the entire project there. I also prepared and uploaded all necessary visual assets into the Overleaf project folder: character images, comic covers, a background image, and the Marvel logo.

The next phase was collaborative: I worked closely with ChatGPT to build the document section by section, page by page. I would explain what I wanted — for example, a clickable “Choose Your Hero” page with character covers that linked to different sections — and the AI would help generate the LaTeX code to make that happen. At times, this process ran smoothly. We completed the cover page (featuring a Marvel logo over a background image), the clickable character selection page, and the full Spider-Man section in a consistent and clean layout.

However, once we moved past Spider-Man and began working on the other characters, things got bumpy. The formatting of the new sections started breaking — text alignment was off, images were oversized, and the layout didn’t match the earlier pages. After hours of troubleshooting and trying different code blocks, I realized that part of the issue stemmed from inconsistent image scaling. Once I manually adjusted the character image sizes at the top of each section (ensuring they scaled properly using LaTeX commands), the formatting issues largely disappeared.

From there, the workflow became a rinse-and-repeat cycle. I would describe the next section, ask for code in small testable chunks, and copy them into Overleaf to make sure everything was working as expected. If the formatting went off or the structure didn’t match the previous sections, I would troubleshoot it with ChatGPT until it matched. Eventually, I switched to a different AI model midway through the project, which noticeably improved consistency and speed.

While there were still moments of trial-and-error — especially when dealing with clickable links and keeping a consistent structure across all character sections — I eventually got the entire document working the way I envisioned. I also added features like background images appearing on every page and checkboxes next to every individual comic issue so that readers can track their progress.

This project ended up being far more time-consuming than I anticipated, but I gained a lot from the experience. I learned how to structure a large-scale document in LaTeX, how to debug formatting issues efficiently, and how to communicate clearly and systematically when working with AI to code collaboratively. Most importantly, I now feel confident tackling a similarly technical creative project in the future, with a better understanding of how to plan, organize, and problem-solve throughout the process.
