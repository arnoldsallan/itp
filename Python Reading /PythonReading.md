Chapter 1 - 

What I knew: I already had a basic understanding that programs involve input, output, execution and repetition (like loops).  

What I did not know: Pretty much everything else in this chapter was new material for me.  I have heard of python due to friends using it and telling me about it, but beyond the name thats as far as my knowledge goes.  I found it interesting that there are multiple versions that you can switch between, and I also thought the idea of formal languases was interesting- those reminded me of the throngles from the new black mirror. 

Ch 3 Functions: 

What I knew: Since we've gone over functions already in class with Java and HTML I knew about these. 

One thing i Didn't know: I didn't realize that functions work in a more mathematical way, in specifics to parameters and arguments.  The mathematics aspect of this is a bit tricky for me! 

CH 5 Conditionals and Recursions: 

What I knew: I was already aware of boolean expressions!  I believe that was covered during our first class if im not mistaken.  Statements that are true or false.  

One thing I didn't know : Honestly most of this section was new to me but the main thing that stood out to me that was interesting was this idea of infinite recursion (almost sounds like something cool out of a sci fi movie).  Was intersting to see how this was something to avoid. 

CH 10 Lists 

What I Knew: I feel like I did know the concept of a list, which would be a sequence of numbers or values.  I also feel like I knew about the brackets and the nesting in a very basic way, maybe im wrong but I think that's already been in some of the coding we've done thus far?  

One thing I didn't know: Alot of these functions and code relating to lists is new to me . Im curious to learn more about how to write and execute it!
