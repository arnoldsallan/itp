# Marvel Comics Reading Order Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

**Marvel Comics Reading Order Guide**


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project.

My project is a comprehensive database of the reading order for a few specific popular marvel comic characters.  This will cover from the beginning issues all the way to current.  

---

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project:

1. Crushing Krisis’ Reading Order Guides (for Spider-Man, Punisher, Daredevil, X-Men, and Wolverine)
2. Comic Book Herald’s Reading Order Guides
3. Marvel Comics Wiki and Official Marvel Publication Lists

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project will result in a PDF guide that could be hosted as a website or an app, that catalogues the major comic book story arcs of Spider-Man, Punisher, Daredevil, X-Men, and Wolverine, segmented by comic book eras (Silver Age, Bronze Age, Modern Age). The guide will include only the key multi-issue arcs for each character, avoiding minor tie-ins and filler stories. The PDF will be structured with clear headers and organized chronologically within each era. To create the document, I will compile data from reliable comic book reading order resources, verify issue lists for accuracy, and format the final output for clarity and ease of use. The software used for creating the PDF will include text editors (for content compilation) and PDF authoring tools (for final formatting and presentation).

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

No, this project is solely for this class.

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project.

A comprehensive PDF guide that lists the major story arcs of Spider-Man, Punisher, Daredevil, X-Men, and Wolverine, organized by era, without errors or missing key arcs, to help new readers guide a pretty complex and conveluted comic universe.

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project.

The guide includes additional context for each arc, such as publication years and significant plot points, enhancing the reader’s understanding of each character's story progression.

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project.

The PDF is visually appealing, with well-designed section headers and Marvel-themed graphics, and includes clickable internal links for easy navigation between characters and eras.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

### Week 1:
Gather data from reliable sources such as Crushing Krisis and Comic Book Herald and organize said information by character and era.

### Week 2:
Start drafting the content and cross-reference major arcs with official Marvel sources to maintain consistency.

### Week 3:
Begin formatting the document, choosing a clean layout. Add in graphics that are related to Marvel comics

### Week 4:
Proofread and perform QC, ensuring all sections are organized correctly. Test internal links and finalize the PDF format.

### Week 5:
Submit the project.

New skills I may need to develop include advanced PDF formatting techniques and learning to incorporate interactive elements (such as clickable links) within the document. I will also research graphic design methods to integrate Marvel-themed visuals effectively.
